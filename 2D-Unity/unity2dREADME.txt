The commit I have put forward was for V1.6 of the 2d Zombie Shooter. My reasoning for setting up a second repo was
due to technical difficulties that made me unable to use the previous repo to commit changes.

Credit goes to GameDevMarket for the sound FX for the guns and zombies that I have used in my project.
